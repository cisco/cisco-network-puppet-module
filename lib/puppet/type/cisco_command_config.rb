# The `cisco_command_config` type allows raw configurations to be managed
# by puppet. It serves as a stopgap until specialized types are created.
#
# It has the following limitations:
# * The input message buffer is limited to 500KB
# * Order is important. Some dependent commands may fail if their associated
#   `feature` configuration is not enabled first
# * Indentation counts! It implies sub-mode configuration. Use the switch's
#   running-config as a guide and do not indent configurations that are not
#   normally indented. Do not use tabs to indent.
# * Inline comments must be prefixed by ! or #
# * Negating a submode will also remove configuratons under that submode,
#   without having to specify every submode config statement:
#   `no router ospf RED` removes all configuration under router ospf RED
# * Syntax does not auto-complete: use `Ethernet1/1`, not `Eth1/1`
# * If a CLI command is rejected during configuration, the resource will abort
#   at that point and will not continue to issue any remaining CLI. For this
#   reason it is recommended to limit the scope of each instance of this
#   resource.

  <name> is the name of the cisco_command_config instance.

  Example
    cisco_command_config {\"feature-config\":
      command => \"
                  feature interface-vlan\"
    }

    cisco_command_config {\"feature-intf-portchannel2\":
