## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

This document describes the process for writing [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/blob/master/README.md) Test Cases for cisco puppet providers.

## <a name="pre-install">Pre-Install Tasks</a>

### Platform and Software Support

Beaker Release 2.14.1 and later.

### Disk space

400MB of free disk space on bootflash is recommended before installing the
puppet agent software on the target agent node.

### Environment
NX-OS supports two possible environments for running 3rd party software:
`bash-shell` and `guestshell`. Choose one environment for running the
puppet agent software. You may run puppet from either environment but not both
at the same time.

* `bash-shell`
  * This is the native WRL linux environment underlying NX-OS. It is disabled by default.
* `guestshell`
  * This is a secure linux container environment running CentOS. It is enabled by default.

Access the following [link](README-agent-install.md) for more information on enabling these environments.

### Install Beaker

[Install Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/Beaker-Installation) on your designated beaker server.

### Configure NX-OS

You must enable the ssh feature and give sudo access to the 'devops' user for the Beaker workstation to access the Puppet agent during testing.

**Example:**

~~~bash
configure terminal
  feature ssh
  username devops password devopspassword role network-admin
  username devops shelltype bash
end
~~~

## <a name="beaker-config">Beaker Server Configuration</a>

The following commands should be run on your Beaker workstation.

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-puppet-module.git
$ cd cisco-network-puppet-module/tests/beaker_tests/
~~~

### Create `host.cfg` File

Under the `beaker_tests` directory, create file named `host.cfg` and add the following content.

Replace the `< >` markers with specific information.

```bash
HOSTS:
    <agent1>:
        roles:
            - agent
        platform: cisco-7-x86_64
        ip: <fully qualified domain name>
        vrf: <vrf used for beaker workstation and puppet master ip reachability>
        ssh:
          auth_methods: ["password"]
          user: <configured bash-shell username>
          password: <configured bash-shell password>
        #Uncomment the following line to install into the guestshell
        #target: guestshell


    #<agent2>:
    #  <...>

    #<agent3>:
    #  <...>

    <master>:
        # Note: Only one master configuration block allowed
        roles:
            - master
        platform: <server os-version-architecture>
        ip: <fully qualifed domain name>
        ssh:
          # Root user/password must be configured for master.
          auth_methods: ["password"]
          user: root
          password: <configured root password>
```

Here is a sample `host.cfg` file where `< >` markers have been replaced with actual data.

```bash
HOSTS:
    agent1:
        roles:
            - agent
        platform: cisco-7-x86_64
        ip: agent1.domain.com
        vrf: management
        #target: guestshell
        ssh:
          auth_methods: ["password"]
          user: devops
          password: devopspassword

    puppetmaster1:
        roles:
            - master
        platform: ubuntu-1404-x86_64
        ip: puppetmaster1.domain.com
        ssh:
          auth_methods: ["password"]
          user: root
          password: rootpassword
```

## <a name="beaker-run">Running a Beaker Test</a>

To run a beaker test from the `beaker_tests` directory, use the following command.

```bash
beaker --hosts hosts.cfg --pre-suite presuite/presuite-certcheck.rb \
--no-validate --no-configure \
--test vtp/vtp-provider-defaults.rb
```

**NOTE:** This runs a vtp test, but any other tests under the `beaker_tests` directory can be run in the same manner.

## <a name="basic-example-feature-tunnel">Basic Example: feature tunnel</a>

This example is a continuation of the examples used in other developer guides: [README-develop-node-utils-APIs.md](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-node-utils/blob/develop/docs/README-develop-node-utils-APIs.md) and [README-develop-types-providers.md](docs/README-develop-types-providers.md).

* To review, the NX-OS CLI for `feature tunnel` is a simple on / off style configuration:

`[no] feature tunnel`

This resource has no other properties so it will have limited testing.

## <a name="s1-basic">Step 1. Create the beaker test script: tunnel</a>

* First, create a `tunnel` directory in the `beaker_tests` directory:

~~~bash
mkdir tests/beaker_tests/tunnel
~~~

* There are template files in `/docs` that may help guide development of new beaker test scripts. These templates provide most of the necessary code with a few customizations required for a new resource. Copy the `template-beaker-feature.rb` file to use as the basis for our new `test_tunnel.rb` beaker file:

~~~bash
cp docs/template-beaker-feature.rb  tests/beaker_tests/tunnel/test_tunnel.rb
~~~

* Edit `test_tunnel.rb` and substitute the placeholder text as shown here:

~~~bash
/X__RESOURCE_NAME__X/tunnel/
~~~

#### Example: test_tunnel.rb test script

This is the completed beaker script for the tunnel resource, based on `template-beaker-feature.rb`:

## <a name="s2-basic">Step 2. Run the script: tunnel</a>

The beaker tool must have access to the `beaker_tests` directory. This could mean running beaker directly from your development workspace or from an entirely different server. For example, some developers prefer to use a dedicated beaker workstation in which case sshfs can be used to softlink the `beaker_tests` directory from the beaker workstation.

Run the beaker tool against the `test_tunnel` script:

_(Some output truncated for brevity)_

```bash
beaker --host hosts.cfg --no-validate --no-configure --test beaker_tests/tunnel/test_tunnel.rb

## <a name="complex-example-router-eigrp">Complex Example: router eigrp</a>

This example is a continuation of the examples used in other developer guides: [README-develop-node-utils-APIs.md](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-node-utils/blob/develop/docs/README-develop-node-utils-APIs.md) and [README-develop-types-providers.md](docs/README-develop-types-providers.md).

* To review, the NX-OS CLI for `router eigrp` is a multi-level, multiple instance configuration. For the purposes of this example the test will focus on testing a single router instance and just two properties:

~~~
[no] feature eigrp
[no] router eigrp [name]    (string)
       maximum-paths [n]    (integer)
  [no] shutdown             (boolean)
~~~

Note that the `router eigrp` provider doesn't require any knowledge of `feature eigrp` because the feature configuration is controlled automatically by the `router eigrp` node_utils API.


## <a name="s1-comp">Step 1. Create the beaker test script: eigrp</a>

* First, create an `eigrp` directory in the `beaker_tests` directory:

~~~bash
mkdir tests/beaker_tests/eigrp
~~~

* There are template files in `/docs` that may help guide development of new beaker test scripts. These templates provide most of the necessary code with a few customizations required for a new resource. Copy the `template-beaker-router.rb` file to use as the basis for our new `test_eigrp.rb` beaker file:

~~~bash
cp docs/template-beaker-router.rb  tests/beaker_tests/tunnel/test_eigrp.rb
~~~

* Edit `test_eigrp.rb` and substitute the placeholder text as shown here:

~~~bash
/X__RESOURCE_NAME__X/eigrp/
~~~

# Beaker: Test Script Variable Reference

#### Table of Contents

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Test Prerequisites](#tp)
* [Return Codes](#rc)
* [The `tests` Hash](#tests)
 * [Top-level Keys](#tlk)
 * [Test Case Keys](#tck)
* [Title Pattern Testing](#tpt)

## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

The beaker test scripts have gone through a number of rewrites in an effort to reduce the time required to develop new test scripts. The current revision uses a `tests` hash as a container for all of the inputs required to fully run each test case. This document is a common reference for the `tests` hash and other required test variables.

## <a name="tp">Test Prerequisites</a>

Each test case in each test file makes basic assumptions about the state of the test environment:

* The beaker host configuration file is set up with proper access credentials for agent and master
* The Puppet Master daemon is running
* SSH is enabled in the agent environment
* The agent SSL certificate has been generated and signed by the Puppet Master

## <a name="rc">Return Codes</a>

The beaker tests will validate tests using return codes from bash and puppet commands:

#### Bash Command Return Codes

* `0` = successful command execution
* `> 0` = unsuccessful command execution

#### Puppet Command Return Codes

* `0` = No Changes have occurred (idempotence tests)
* `1` = An Error has been raised
* `2` = Changes have occurred (manifest tests)
* `4` = A Failure has occurred
* `6` = A Change and Failure has occurred

*Note: The beaker `on()` method has an optional `options` parameter, which allows the caller to specify `:acceptable_exit_codes`. If this is not specified it will default to `0`.*

## <a name="tests">The `tests` hash</a>

The `tests` hash is a convenient container for common and custom test variables. Common variables that are used by all test cases are defined as top-level keys, while each test case is a top-level key with the test case variables defined as the key-value; for example:

```ruby
# A top-level key for common variables
tests = {
  resource_name: 'cisco_bgp_neighbor_af',
}

# A test-case key with test variables within
tests[:bgp_weight] = {
  manifest_props: { weight: '30' },
}
```

Custom keys may be added for various unique test requirements but they should be documented in this guide.

### <a name="tlk">Top-level Keys</a>

##### Required Top-level keys

| Key Name         | Value and Usage
|:-----------------|:---------------
| `:agent`         | The `agent` object variable name. It is used for accessing the agent environment.
| `:master`        | The `master` object variable name. It is used for accessing the puppet master environment.
| `:resource_name` | The resource name used in the test. This is primarily used with the `puppet resource` command.

##### Optional Top-level keys

| Key Name         | Value and Usage
|:-----------------|:---------------
| `:asn`           | An Autonomous-System number. Used in some routing protocol tests.
| `:encap_prof_global` | The global encapsulation profile configuration. This configuration is a dependency for testing with `cisco_interface_service_vni`.
| `:intf_type`     | The interface type string, e.g. `ethernet`. Used in tests that require an interface, in which case the test will discover the first interface of that type to use for the tests.
| `:platform`      | A regexp pattern to match against the agent's product-id value. This is used to skip tests that don't support a feature or parameter. This key can be specified as a common top-level key or on a test-by-test basis.
| `:preclean`      | The resource name used to remove a configuration as part of testbed pre-cleanup. The resource does not have to be the same as the one being tested; for example, the `'cisco_bgp_af'` test might use `'cisco_bgp'` for `:preclean` if a full bgp cleanup is needed instead of just removing the `'cisco_bgp_af'` configuration. This key can be specified as a common top-level key or on a test-by-test basis.
| `:sid`           | The service ID (Integer). Used in `cisco_interface_service_vni` tests.

##### Example: Top-level Keys

```ruby
tests = {
  master:        master,
  agent:         agent,
  platform:      'n(3|9)k',          # Restrict testing to N3k & N9k
  resource_name: 'cisco_interface',
  intf_type:     'ethernet',
}
```

### <a name="tck">Test Case Keys</a>

The keys are all optional. Most test cases will typically only use `:desc` and `:manifest_props`.

| Key Name    | Value and Usage
|:------------|:---------------
| `:desc`           | A text description for the test case. This is used for logging and debugs.
| `:manifest_props` | A hash of property names and their values. The script will generate a manifest from this hash and create it as a file on the puppet master. If the `:resource` key is not specified then this hash will also be used to generate a hash of expected values for use by the `puppet resource` command validation test.
| `:platform`       | A regexp pattern to match against the agent's product-id value. This is used to skip tests that don't support a feature or parameter. This key can be specified as a common top-level key or on a test-by-test basis.
| `:preclean`       | The resource name used to remove a configuration as part of testbed pre-cleanup. The resource does not have to be the same as the one being tested; for example, the `'cisco_bgp_af'` test might use `'cisco_bgp'` for `:preclean` if a full bgp cleanup is needed instead of just removing the `'cisco_bgp_af'` configuration. This key can be specified as a common top-level key or on a test-by-test basis.
| `:resource`       | A hash of expected values from the `puppet resource` command. This is only needed when the expected values differ from the values defined by `:manifest_props`; for example: default testing may specify a value of `'default'` in the manifest but an expected value of `'true'` for the `puppet resource` command.
| `:ensure`         | The ensure value: `'present'` or `'absent'`. If not specified the test case will default to `'present'`.
| `:code`           | An array of acceptable return codes; e.g. `[0, 2]`. This is used to override the default return codes expected by the common test harness. It is rarely needed but some platforms / properties require this override.
| `:title_pattern`  | The title string to use in the manifest. Most providers use simple title patterns, in which case this is a simple string value. Providers like bgp_neighbor_af use complex title patterns, in which case they will use this key by itself for general property testing, then use it in combination with the `:title_params` key to perform complex title pattern testing.
| `:remote_as`      | An Autonomous-System number. Used in BGP tests to set up an eBGP configuraton to test eBGP-only properties.
| `:title_params` | A hash of title parameters. See [Title Pattern Testing](#tpt) below.


##### Example: Test Case: basic

```ruby
tests[:basic_1] = {
  manifest_props: {
    'allowas_in' => 'false',
  }
}
```

This simple test case definition tells the test harness to:

* set `:title_pattern` and `:desc` to key name (`'basic_1'`)
* ignore any platform checks (`:platform` is not specified)
* skip pre cleaning (`:preclean` is not specified)
* create a `:resource` expected values hash from `:manifest_props` since the expect values from `puppet resource` will be the same as those in the manifest


This test case can be called with the following syntax:

```ruby
test_harness_run(tests, :basic_1)
```

##### Example: Test Case: bgp_neighbor_af (defaults)


```ruby
tests[:default] = {
  desc:           'Default Properties',
  preclean:       'cisco_bgp',
  title_pattern:  '2 default 1.1.1.1 ipv4 unicast',
  manifest_props: {
    allowas_in:  'default',
  }
  resource:
    'allowas_in' => 'false',
  }
}
```

This test requires extra keys:

* An explicit `:desc` string is desired though not required
* bgp_neighbor_af has complex title patterns so using the test case key name won't work
* precleaning is required because it's the first test of many and the testbed state will be unknown
* `:manifest_props` is using `'default'` values so a `:resource` hash is needed to defined different expect values for `puppet resource`

This test case can be called with the following syntax:


```ruby
test_harness_run(tests, :default)
```

##### Example: Test Case: bgp_neighbor_af (non defaults)

```ruby
tests[:non_def_M] = {
  desc:           'Non Default: (M) max-prefix',
  manifest_props: {
    'allowas_in' => 'false',
  }
}
```

This tests the same property as the 'defaults' test before it but in this case it's just explicitly setting the property value so it just needs `:manifest_props` defined. The `:desc` is helpful but not required.

This test case can be called with the following syntax:

```ruby
test_harness_run(tests, :non_def_M)
```


### <a name="tpt">Title Pattern Testing</a>

Some providers support complex title patterns, in which case parameters (*these are the `newparameter()` methods found in the resource type files*) can obtain their values from
 either explicit assignments or from the title pattern itself; e.g.

```ruby
# Example A. parameters from the title string only

cisco_bgp { '55 red': }

# Example B. parameters from both the title string and explicit assignment

cisco_bgp { '55':
  vrf => 'red'
}
```

The `puppet resource` command requires a full title string that contains all of the required parameters, so the title string in Example A will not work by itself and the string must be merged appropriately with the explicit parameters to use it with `puppet resource`.

General property testing will not need this special title pattern munging but there should be additional testing for just the title patterns. This can be accomplished by using the `:title_params` key to define explicit title parameters to munge with a less explicit `:title_pattern`, resulting in a complete title string for puppet resource.

##### Example: bgp_neighbor_af `title_pattern` test cases

```ruby
tests[:title_patterns_1] = {
  desc:          'T.1 Title Pattern',
  preclean:      'cisco_vrf',
  title_pattern: 'new_york',
  title_params:  { vrf: 'red', afi: 'ipv4', safi: 'unicast' },
  resource:      { 'ensure' => 'present' },
  # This test will result in a manifest title string: 'new_york'
  # and a puppet resource title string: 'red ipv4 unicast'
}

tests[:title_patterns_2] = {
  desc:          'T.2 Title Pattern',
  title_pattern: 'blue',
  title_params:  { afi: 'ipv4', safi: 'unicast' },
  resource:      { 'ensure' => 'present' },
  # This test will result in a manifest title string: 'blue'
  # and a puppet resource title string: 'blue ipv4 unicast'
}

tests[:title_patterns_3] = {
  desc:          'T.3 Title Pattern',
  title_pattern: 'cyan ipv4',
  title_params:  { safi: 'unicast' },
  resource:      { 'ensure' => 'present' },
  # This test will result in a manifest title string: 'cyan ipv4'
  # and a puppet resource title string: 'cyan ipv4 unicast'
}
```
The title pattern tests can now be called with this syntax:

```ruby
  test_harness_run(tests, :title_patterns_1)
  test_harness_run(tests, :title_patterns_2)
  test_harness_run(tests, :title_patterns_3)
```
