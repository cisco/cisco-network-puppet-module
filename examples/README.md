## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

This document describes how to use the example demo manifest files contained within the `examples` directory.  There are several different demo's to choose from.

* `demo_site.pp`
  * Provides basic sample manifests to demo all cisco providers.
* `demo_roles_site.pp`
  * Provides a role based hierarchical set of sample manifests that can be used to demonstrate configuration of switches with different roles in a network.
* `demo_bgp_[ipv4|ipv6]_site.pp`
  * Provides sample manifests to configure bgp using the `cisco_command_config` provider.

**Note:** Before following the steps in this guide make sure the puppet agent is [installed and configured.](../docs/README-agent-install.md)

## <a name="setup">Initial Setup</a>

### (Optional:) Uninstall Older Version of the `puppetlabs-ciscopuppet` Module.

If your puppet master has an older version of the `puppetlabs-ciscopuppet` module installed go ahead and uninstall it now.

#### List Current Module

```bash
puppetmaster:# puppet module list
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
|
+-- puppetlabs-ciscopuppet (v0.9.0)
/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules (no modules installed)
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules (no modules installed)
```

#### Remove Current Module

```bash
puppetmaster:# puppet module uninstall puppetlabs-ciscopuppet
Notice: Preparing to uninstall 'puppetlabs-ciscopuppet' ...
Removed 'puppetlabs-ciscopuppet' (v0.9.0) from /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
```

### Build and Install `puppetlabs-ciscopuppet` Module.

The recommended workflow is to clone the `cisco-ciscopuppet.git` repository on your puppet master.  This allows for easy build and installation of the `puppetlabs-ciscopuppet` module.

#### Clone the `cisco-network-puppet-module.git` repo on your puppet master

```bash
puppetmaster:# git clone https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-puppet-module.git
```

#### Build the `puppetlabs-ciscopuppet` module on your puppet master

Issue the following command one layer **above** the `cisco-network-puppet-module` directory on your puppet master.

```bash
puppetmaster:# puppet module build cisco-network-puppet-module/
Notice: Building /githubpuppet/cisco-network-puppet-module for release
Module built: /githubpuppet/cisco-network-puppet-module/pkg/puppetlabs-ciscopuppet-0.9.0.tar.gz
```

#### Install the `puppetlabs-ciscopuppet` module on your puppet master

```bash
puppetmaster:# cd cisco-ciscopuppet/pkg/
puppetmaster:# puppet module install ./puppetlabs-ciscopuppet-[version].tar.gz
Notice: Preparing to install into /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules ...
Notice: Downloading from https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
|
+-- puppetlabs-ciscopuppet (v0.9.0)
```

**Note:** Optionally, restart your puppet server following the install.


#### Copy all demo files under the `modules/ciscopuppet/examples/` directory to the `modules/ciscopuppet/manifests` directory

```bash
puppetmaster:# cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/ciscopuppet/examples
puppetmaster:# cp -r ./demo* /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/ciscopuppet/manifests/
```

## <a name="basic-demo">Run Basic Demo</a>

The basic demo covers all existing cisco providers using a flat hierarchy.  The `demo_site.pp` file is the sample `site.pp` file for this demo.  For a current list of all cisco providers included in this demo visit the `demo_all.pp` file.

### Copy `demo_site.pp` file to `production/manifests` directory

```bash
puppetmaster:# cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/ciscopuppet/examples
puppetmaster:# cp ./demo_site.pp /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
```

### Modify the `site.pp` file to use your agent node name

```puppet
node 'your_node_name' {  <---------------- Modify
  include ciscopuppet::demo_all
}
```
### Apply the demo `site.pp` manifest using the `puppet agent -t` command on the agent

```bash
root@n9k#puppet agent -t

## <a name="role-based-demo">Run Role Based Demo</a>

The role based demo covers resources that can be applied to switches that perform different roles in the network.  The `demo_roles_site.pp` file is the sample `site.pp` file for this demo.

### Copy `demo_roles_site.pp` file to `production/manifests` directory

```bash
puppetmaster:# cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/ciscopuppet/examples
puppetmaster:# cp ./demo_roles_site.pp /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
```

#### Modify the `site.pp` file to use your agent node names

```puppet
node 'your_n9k-edge-switch' {   <---------------- Modify
  include ciscopuppet::demo_role::edge_switch
}

node 'your_n9k-internal-switch' {   <---------------- Modify
  include ciscopuppet::demo_role::internal_switch
}

node 'your_n3k-internal-switch' {   <---------------- Modify
  include demo_role::internal_switch
}
```
#### Apply the demo `site.pp` manifest using the `puppet agent -t` command on the agent

## <a name="bgp-demo">Run BGP IPv4/IPv6 Demo</a>

The BGP [IPv4|IPv6] demo uses the `cisco_command_config` provider to apply sample bgp configuraton.  The `demo_bgp_[ipv4|ipv6]_site.pp` file is the sample `site.pp` file for this demo.

### Copy `demo_bgp_[ipv4|ipv6]_site.pp` file to `production/manifests` directory

```bash
puppetmaster:# cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/ciscopuppet/examples
puppetmaster:# cp ./demo_bgp_[ipv4|ipv6]_site.pp /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
```

#### Modify the `site.pp` file to use your agent node name

```puppet
node 'cisco_[bgpv4|bgpv6]_device_name' {  <------ Modify
  include ciscopuppet::demo_bgp_[ipv4|ipv6]
}
```
#### Apply the demo `site.pp` manifest using the `puppet agent -t` command on the agent
