# CISCOCOMMAND Utility Library:
# -----------------------------
# ciscocommandlib.rb
#
# This is the utility library for the CISCOCMD provider Beaker test cases that
# contains the common methods used across the CISCOCMD testsuite's cases. The
# library is implemented as a module with related methods and constants defined
# inside it for use as a namespace. All of the methods are defined as module
# methods.
#
# Every Beaker CISCOCMD test case that runs an instance of Beaker::TestCase
# requires CiscoCommandLib module.
#
# The module has a single set of methods:
# A. Methods to create manifests for cisco_command_config Puppet test cases.
module CiscoCommandLib
  # A. Methods to create manifests for cisco_command_config Puppet test cases.

  # Method to create a manifest for CISCOCOMMAND resource attribute:
  # command.
  # 'command' is set to the NXOS command list to be applied to switch config.
  # @param none [None] No input parameters exist.
  # @result none [None] Returns no object.
