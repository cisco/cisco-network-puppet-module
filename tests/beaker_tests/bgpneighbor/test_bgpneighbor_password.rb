# TestCase Name:
# -------------
# BgpNeighbor-Provider-password.rb
#
# TestCase Prerequisites:
# -----------------------
# This is a Puppet BGP Neighbor resource testcase for Puppet Agent on Nexus
# devices.
# The test case assumes the following prerequisites are already satisfied:
# A. Host configuration file contains agent and master information.
# B. SSH is enabled on the Agent.
# C. Puppet master/server is started.
# D. Puppet agent certificate has been signed on the Puppet master/server.
#
# TestCase:
# ---------
# This is a BGP Neighbor resource test that tests for password and type
# attributes when created with 'ensure' => 'present'.
#
# The testcode checks for exit_codes from Puppet Agent, Vegas shell and
# Bash shell command executions. For Vegas shell and Bash shell command
# string executions, this is the exit_code convention:
# 0 - successful command execution, > 0 - failed command execution.
# For Puppet Agent command string executions, this is the exit_code convention:
# 0 - no changes have occurred, 1 - errors have occurred,
# 2 - changes have occurred, 4 - failures have occurred and
# 6 - changes and failures have occurred.
#
# Note: 0 is the default exit_code checked in Beaker::DSL::Helpers::on() method.
#
# The testcode also uses RegExp pattern matching on stdout or output IO
# instance attributes to verify resource properties.
