# TestCase Name:
# --------------
# TacacsServer-Provider-NonDefaults.rb
#
# TestCase Prerequisites:
# -----------------------
# This is a Puppet TACACSSERVER testcase for Puppet Agent on Nexus devices.
# The test case assumes the following prerequisites are already satisfied:
# A. Populating the HOSTS configuration file with the agent and master
# information.
# B. Enabling SSH connection prerequisites on the N9K switch based Agent.
# C. Starting of Puppet master server on master.
# D. Sending to and signing of Puppet agent certificate request on master.
#
# TestCase:
# ---------
# This is a TACACSSERVER resource test that tests for nondefault values for
# ensure, timeout, deadtime, encryption_type,
# encryption_password, directed_request and source_interface attributes of a
# cisco_tacacs_server resource when created with 'ensure' => 'present'.
#
# There are 2 sections to the testcase: Setup, group of teststeps.
# The 1st step is the Setup teststep that cleans up the switch state.
# Steps 2-4 deal with cisco_tacacs_server_resource creation and its
# verification using Puppet Agent and the switch running-config.
# Steps 5-7 deal with cisco_tacacs_server resource deletion and its
# verification using Puppet Agent and the switch running-config.
#
# The testcode checks for exit_codes from Puppet Agent, Vegas shell and
# Bash shell command executions. For Vegas shell and Bash shell command
# string executions, this is the exit_code convention:
# 0 - successful command execution, > 0 - failed command execution.
# For Puppet Agent command string executions, this is the exit_code convention:
# 0 - no changes have occurred, 1 - errors have occurred,
# 2 - changes have occurred, 4 - failures have occurred and
# 6 - changes and failures have occurred.
# 0 is the default exit_code checked in Beaker::DSL::Helpers::on() method.
# The testcode also uses RegExp pattern matching on stdout or output IO
# instance attributes of Result object from on() method invocation.
